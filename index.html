    <h1> Week 3 </h1>
    <h2>Reading Response</h2>
    <p>I was very inspired by Detroit’s Equitable Internet Initiative and their approach to making the Internet accessible to all by teaching community members how to build their own wireless networks. I would not only do this but also start an initiative to teach people how to program so that our country could have its own major online services created by the people in our country. This would create lots of jobs and build a local tech economy. So not only would people have their own high-speed internet, but we would also have our own forms of social media, email, streaming, gaming, etc.  </p>

       <p>I am curious to know what the internet would look like if it were not funded and created for military purposes. Would the internet even exist without the government's efforts to win the cold war? What stood out to me the most during this reading was how all of the names mentioned were men. When reading about the creation of the internet, I found it funny that emails were originally built as a way for young men to discuss “science fiction, football, ham radios, cars, chess, and bridge”. These young men had elite access to the ARPANET because they were at elite academic institutions and were given opportunities that women did not have access to. If I could go back in time, I would make sure that women were equally as involved in engineering and computer science. I would probably focus on the universities and change the past so that women would be allowed to attend the universities so if they wished to work in computer science they could. When I researched on my own I found out that In 1969, Yale became the first Ivy League university to allow female students. After that, a lot of other Ivy League colleges began to welcome women, but slowly. For example, women were not allowed at Columbia University until 1983. (https://historycollection.com/40-basic-rights-women-did-not-have-until-the-1970s/15/)  In response to the “great man theory” of history, I noticed that although the creation of the internet has several big names leading the projects, it seemed to me like it was a very collaborative effort. Students and scientists from all over the country used the ARPANET to experiment and develop new ways of communication. It was not just created by one genius. And these men involved were given the opportunity due to their circumstances, not just because they were "great men".
